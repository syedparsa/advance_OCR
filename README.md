# Advance OCR

It's an android app to convert picture directly from Camera to Text, iT can translate to 59 different languages. It can also share the translated version with someone else or you can also make it speak that text.

## Usage

You just need to scan the Text using a built-in Camera and after selecting your desire language in which you want it to translate your text, Press next and it will take you to the next Page. On the second page, you can share it with someone else or you can make it speak that text.

If the model of translation isn't downloaded on mobile it will download it automatically.

## Implementation

I have used [Google ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/) for text recognition and translation. Moreover, I have used [Google TextToSpeech Library](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/tts/TextToSpeech) to make it speak the translated Text.
